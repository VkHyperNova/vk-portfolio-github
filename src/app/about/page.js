            <p>
              I’m a junior software developer with approximately 5–10 years of
              on-and-off coding experience. I’m mostly self-taught and have learned
              programming through personal projects, online courses, and consistent
              hands-on experimentation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Alongside self-study, I have formal education from{" "}
              <span className="font-medium">Kutsehariduskeskus</span> and practical
              industry experience through internships at two software companies.
              These experiences helped me understand how real software is built,
              reviewed, and maintained in a team environment.

            <p>
              My current focus is <span className="font-medium">Go (Golang)</span>,
              where I build small programs and tools for personal use. I enjoy
              writing clear, maintainable code and understanding how programs work
              under the hood.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m comfortable working on both frontend and backend. On the frontend,
              I build clean and responsive user interfaces. On the backend, I focus
              on APIs, data flow, and basic system design. I also have experience
              working with <span className="font-medium">WordPress</span> for content
              management and simple dynamic websites.

            I don’t rely on “vibe coding” or blindly copying solutions. I prefer to
            understand how things work and write my own code. I do use AI as a helper
            for learning, debugging, and exploring ideas—but the final code is
            something I fully understand and can explain.
